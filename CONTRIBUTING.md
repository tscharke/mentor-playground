6. Make the tests pass (again).

7. Push to your fork. 

8. [Submit a pull request (PR)][pr].

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to comment on pull requests and may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Format all your code with the given [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)-configuration.
* Write tests.
* Be as verbose as possible, because the code must be plausible for beginners too.
* Write a simple and [good commit message][commit].
