# Mentor Playground

This is a collection of code snippets to show the concepts of [React](https://react.dev) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) **in a pragmatic way**.

All `code snippets` are available in kind of Components, Tests, (Utility) Functions, etc.

The goal is to show replicating and adaptable **concepts** and **techniques**.

Thereby, the comprehensibility and self-explanation within the code is in the foreground.
It will make it possible, even for beginners, to find inspiration.

So, you need to look at the output on the `console` along with the code.
In other words: **Always have your developer tools open** 😁

It's important to note that I am showing some ways and approaches here.
There is no generally right or wrong way (apart from "real" mistakes 😉).

## 🧑‍🎨 Can we see something?

Yes, 😃 there's an executable App (at [Codesandbox](https://githubbox.com/tscharke/mentor-playground)),
that can also run locally on your machine ([see below](#-setup-on-your-machine)).

**Keep in mind**: The focus is still on the `code` and `tests` and not on a fancy UI/UX with enterprise-relevant features 😉

## 🚀 Mission

This repository is a start and should grow 💪.

Feel free to post your ideas or questions in the form of issues. Often a single sentence is enough (e.g., the title of an issue).

I am happy about every pull request (PR) from you too.
Regardless if it adds concepts, corrects errors, simplifies things or describes things
better—whatever comes to your mind 🥳.
