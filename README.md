# Mentor Playground

This repository contains a collection of code pieces to show the concepts of
[React](https://react.dev) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) in a
pragmatic way by following the source code and the tests.

I call it (my) _Mentor Playground_, because I use all snippets during training and mentoring.

The goal is to demonstrate **concepts** and **techniques** that can be replicated and adopted.

So there is an executable app (at [Codesandbox](https://githubbox.com/tscharke/mentor-playground)),
that can also run locally on your machine ([see below](#-setup-on-your-machine)). The focus is still on the `code` and `tests`
and not on a fancy UI/UX with enterprise-relevant features üòâ

Therefore, it is essential to look at the output on the `console` along with the code.
In other words: **Always have your developer tools open** üòÅ

| üöß Please be aware‚Ä¶                                                                                                                                 |

| That everything in this repository is a _work in progress_ and is constantly changing and improving. Therefore, there is never a finished version. |

## üöÄ Mission

The idea, or better vision, is to eventually provide all snippets with verbose and spoken
tests that are so self-explanatory that no further comments on the code (or console) are needed.

## üíª Setup (on your machine)

```bash
# Check out the main-branch of this repository and switch into this directory
git clone git@github.com:tscharke/mentor-playground.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install 

# Run development-server
pnpm run start
```
